🚚 Order Tracking – View the details and real-time status of your placed orders, with data fetched via a loader and updates managed by an action.

🔒 Protected Routes – Secure access to core functionalities (Menu, Cart, Create Order, Order Details) using a ProtectedWeb component, ensuring only authorized users can access these parts of the application.

⚡ Optimized Data Fetching – Efficient data loading for menu and order details through React Router's loader mechanism, preventing unnecessary re-renders and improving UX.

🔄 Data Mutations – Seamless order creation and updates are handled declaratively with React Router's action functions.

🧠 Usage Tips
Home Page: This is the entry point to the application.
Menu: Navigate to the /menu route to explore all the delicious pizzas available. Data for the menu is loaded automatically when you visit this route.
Cart: After adding items, head to the /cart to review your order before checkout.
New Order: Ready to order? Fill out your details at /order/new. The form submission is handled by a React Router action.
Track Order: Once you've placed an order, you can use the unique order ID (e.g., /order/12345) to track its status. The order details are fetched via a loader, and you can update the order status using an action.

🔐 Authentication (Placeholder)
This application includes a ProtectedWeb component that wraps several routes (/menu, /cart, /order/new, /order/:orderId). This signifies that these parts of the application are intended to be secure or require a user to be authenticated. In a full-fledged application, the ProtectedWeb component would implement actual authentication logic (e.g., checking for a user token, redirecting to a login page if not authenticated) to control access.
